A simple and formatted accounting export from Woocommerce to accounting softwares.

== Description ==
=Generic Accounting codes and Cost centers=

You can add generic account code for customers, products, shipping and tax.
You also can add a generic cost center for products and shipping.

=Formatted export to make your work simple=

Most of business owners don't have much time to work hours for accounting. And their businesses lack their presence when they have.
Having an accounter can be very expensive, and most of the paid time is only for typing from invoices to accounting software...
Stop waisting your time and money, let's try to make it simple with your Woocommerce shop.
A lot of accounting software don't work in the cloud and you can't use webservices or API with most of them. 
We think it's safer as accounting data is sensitive and implied jobs.
Our export format is quite standard and can easily be adapted form one accounting software to another with some minor changes using excel or Open Office.

=3 Premium versions available if you need more=

If you need more functionnalities (like detailed account codes or cost centers, exceptionnal charges and credits with alerts when income and outcome don\'t match...),
you should have a look to our premium versions on our website : http://www.woocommerce-book-keeper.com )

=Multilingual=

The plugin is already available in English and French but can easily be translated in your language with PO/MO files included.

== Installation ==
This plugin need Woocommerce to be installed and activated on your Wordpress installation.

1. Upload the plugin and uncompress it into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your website.
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.
3. Fill the data fields needed in General Settings menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
=Some orders are not balanced, why?=

Until Woocommerce 2.3, coupons were possibly added after taxes, which is not allowed in accounting (and by the law...) so you might have not matching amounts on these particular sales.
Our premium versions of Woocommerce Book Keeper solve this problem by recalculating the right global amounts. 
Be careful, because your invoices can be wrong too!

=Is Woocommerce Book Keeper compatible with Woocommerce refund system?=

Not yet, but we are working on it.

=Is Woocommerce Book Keeper compatible with invoices plugin?=

The free version is not, but from pro version you can use Woocommerce PDF invoices and packing slips with WBK.

=Is Woocommerce Book Keeper compatible with Woocommerce POS?=

Not really...yet, we\'re thinking about it... But it's quite a huge work to make it great.
As Woocommerce POS is using Woocommerce, you can still use our plugin but your accounting codes and cost centers will be the same as your online shop.

=How can I chose the account code and cost centers?=

You should ask your accountant or consult the general accounting plan for a good configuration. 
It\'s the most difficult part from this plugin, but when everything is OK, everything is rolling on ! B-)

=What gain can be expected from this plugin?=

If your setup is OK, you can dramatically improve your accounting entry and save a lot of time (and money). Even with the free version.
With the premium versions you can have more precise accounting analysis, and some pleasant feature that make your work even easier but this one is fine too ! :-)
